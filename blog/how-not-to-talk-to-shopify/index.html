            <h1 id="how-not-to-tell-shopify-their-button-is-rendering-incorrectly">How not to tell Shopify their button is rendering incorrectly</h1>

<p>I have started to write a massive series of tech books. Basically, a from-almost-nothing-to-web-dev-with-Rails type series with everything a modern Rails dev is asked to know (Ruby, html, scss, sql, nosql, yaml, js, front-end frameworks etc etc).</p>

<p>I've started writing it but one thing I wanted to do was get a realistic picture of what famous Rails companies asked of their new employees.</p>

<p>Shopify is a famous Rails company, I thought. <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">They are even mentioned on the Rails website alongside Basecamp</a> so, a good bet for some of skills required.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.shopify.com/careers/software-developer-2d1dee">Software Dev position</a> was typical of what I looked at. </p>

<p>Sadly, for my purposes not tons of the tech used or required but a worthy shot.</p>

<p>As I scrolled down however, TO MY HORROR!, a button that disappeared part behind the footer.</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" title="Image of shopify button" src="../../images/screenshot-shopify.png" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This seems to happen on every Shopify job posting I have been on as I scrolled right to the bottom of a job post. Was using Chrome. Not sure about other browsers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since early 2014 I've made a point of emailing/flagging up issues to companies (big or small). Doubly so if I pay for a product. I'm not a customer of Shopify but, they'd be more than happy to get a minor error flagged up?</p>

<h2 id="let-me-email-you">Let me email you</h2>

<p>I took a screenshot and the URL and looked for a way to email the team. Found an "email us" button in their footer, pressed that so that I could email the team.</p>

<p>Took me to a contact us page. Hmmmm.</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" title="Image of shopify button" src="../../images/screenshot-contact.png" /></p>

<p>Not exactly "email" us but the section on the left says something about email them. Another button down!</p>

<p>Drum roll…</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" title="Image of shopify button" src="../../images/screenshot-help.png" /></p>

<p>Oh. Not at an email yet. Some commonly asked questions. Mostly about Shopify customer issues. Will to life intact but waning at this point.</p>

<p>Sidebar has yet another email us button. I'll press that. Third time the charm?</p>

<p><img alt="alt text" title="Image of shopify button" src="../../images/screenshot-form.png" /></p>

<p>FINALLY A FORM! Before I got too excited, this form wasn't for <strong><em>me</em></strong>. Everything listed was for customers and nothing about emailing them a small error I found.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have just gamed the form and sent the stuff anyway. But I didn't. I gave up there. Went to twitter. A lot of companies that is the best bet. Should have tried it faster I thought to myself. I'll get the email that way!</p>

<p>Didn't happen.</p>

<p>They replied they were "sorry" to hear I had an issue. Not sure they were paying attention to my tweet honestly (not sure I was direct enough… Wanted an email so I could give them the picture and context). Asked for an email again, but more directly. Not heard back on that, don't think I will.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly most of the ways people contact Shopify would fit within that form but something to remember with a product is that sometimes the pain of letting people have your email is something <strong>you</strong> should deal with. And if you are going to state people can email you, let them do it. A contact form is not necessarily an email to a user or customer's point of view.</p>

<p>So, there it is. That is how you <strong><em>don't</em></strong> tell Shopify their button is broken.</p>

<p>A story worthy of telling your grandchildren is there ever was.</p>
